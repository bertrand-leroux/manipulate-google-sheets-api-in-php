## Installation üì¶

Download the source code:

```
git clone git@github.com:nidup/manipulate-google-sheets-api-in-php.git
cd manipulate-google-sheets-api-in-php
```

Then the installation comes into 2 flavors, directly on your host or using docker.

Once installed the commands are the same, some docker shortcuts are provided in `.docker/bin`.

### Install directly on your system (option A) üíª

Install the PHP dependencies:

```
composer install
```

### Install with docker & docker compose (option B) üêã

Build the docker image and install the PHP dependencies:

```
docker compose up -d
.docker/bin/composer install
```

## Use the console commands üöÄ

Use `bin/console` or `.docker/bin/console` to launch a command.

List the commands:
```
bin/console --env=prod
[...]
nidup
  nidup:google-sheets:manipulate-google-sheets  Manipulate Google Sheets
[...]
```

The example of data is in data/movies-100.csv, it can be imported in a new google sheet.

Then the google sheet id can be used as the argument of the following command.

Launch a command:
```
bin/console nidup:google-sheets:manipulate-google-sheets myGoogleSheetId --env=prod
```

This command contains various examples that can be commented out to read, write, filter, etc.

We use the prod environment here to have the most efficient execution.
